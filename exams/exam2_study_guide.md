Exam 2 - Oct 29, 2024
-----------------------

Study Guide
---------------
### Sockets
- **Definition**: Endpoints for data exchange in networks.
- **TCP**: Connection-oriented, reliable, ordered delivery.
- **UDP**: Connectionless, faster, no delivery guarantees.

### TCP vs. UDP Services
- **TCP**: Reliable delivery, flow control, stream-oriented.
- **UDP**: Lightweight, fast, suitable for real-time applications.

### Network Layer Protocol Services
- Packet forwarding, routing, logical addressing, fragmentation, and error handling.

### Key Functions of Network Layer Protocol
- Packet routing, logical addressing, fragmentation/reassembly, error detection.

### IP Addressing and CIDR
- **IP Addressing**: Unique addresses for devices.
- **CIDR**: Prefix notation (e.g., /24) for efficient IP allocation.

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- **Operation**: Automatically assigns IP addresses.
- **Steps**: Discovery, Offer, Request, Acknowledgment (DORA).
- 
### Routing Forwarding Table
- Identify destinations, determine next hops, update based on protocols.

### TTL (Time to Live)
- **Device**: Routers; prevents packet looping by limiting packet lifespan.

### IPv4 vs. IPv6
- **IPv4**: 32-bit, ~4.3 billion addresses.
- **IPv6**: 128-bit, vast address space; bridging methods include tunneling and dual-stack.

### Switching Fabric
- **Definition**: Internal architecture for data transfer in switches.
- **Types**: Crossbar, shared memory, output-queued.

### IP Fragmentation and Reassembly
- **Fragmentation**: Splitting packets for smaller MTUs.
- **Reassembly**: Combining fragments at the destination.

### NAT, UPnP, and SSDP
- **NAT**: Translates private to public IP addresses.
- **UPnP**: Automatic discovery/configuration of devices.
- **SSDP**: Protocol for device discovery in UPnP.


Exam Guidelines
---------------
- __Format:__ Exams will be open-book and closed-notes.
- __Duration:__ Each exam will last approximately 60 minutes and will take place at the beginning of the class period.
- __Content:__ Exams may include a programming component, as well as practical exercises using Wireshark for network analysis. The latter half of the class may be dedicated to instruction and/or laboratory work.
- __Number of Exams:__ A total of four exams will be administered, with the lowest score being dropped.
- __Make-Up Exams:__ Make-up exams will only be granted with prior approval from the instructor, except in cases of extreme emergency or illness, which must be documented.
