Exam 3 - Nov 21, 2024
-----------------------

### Study Guide:

#### Network Layer
- Why we have Intra-AS and Inter-AS routing?
- Know how Traceroute uses ICMP to find path from one host to another.
- Know how to build a routing forwarding table.
- Make sure you can do both routing algorithms – Link State Algorithms (Dijkstra) and distance vector (Bellman-Ford).
  - [Dijkstra's Algorithm](..\schedule\slides\dijkstra_algorithm.pdf)
  - [CS360: Bellman-Ford Algorithm](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs360-spring2019/lectures/lecture21.html)
  - [CS360: Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs360-spring2019/lectures/lecture22.html)

#### Link Layer
- Know what services the Data Link Layer provides.
- Understand the characteristics of an ideal Multiple Access Protocol.
- Know error detection and correction – parity checking and Internet checksums.
- Know Random Access Protocols and how they deal with collisions.
- Know what Address Resolution Protocol is. How can a host determine the MAC address of a destination machine knowing only its IP address?
- Understand Ethernet switches and differences between switches and routers.
- Know key functions of switches.
- Know differences between switched and bus-based Ethernet.
- Know how to build ARP and switch tables.
