### Problem 2 (8 pts)
Which set of bytes is used to compute the checksum field in the UDP header, and how does this process work?

### Problem 3 (9 pts)
How does a cumulative acknowledgment, ACK(n), function in networking, and what does it signify?

### Problem 4 (10 pts)

### Problem 5 (5 pts)
True or False: It is possible for two UDP segments to be sent from the same socket with source port 1234 at a server to two different clients. 

### Problem 6 (5 pts)
